# Plot Deconstruction for Assignment: Graphical Storytelling in R 
The selected plot is from https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.13034

The plot depicts monthly observed humpback whale entanglements for multiple years in set fishing gear 

The original plot is difficult to read due to colours and the lines connect each monthly value. 

We plan to change the colour scheme and smooth the lines.
